Phase 1
Please add a new feature .
Ducks should now be able to FLY
Phase 2
Add a "mech-robot-duck" that will have machine guns ,
flame-thrower and use rocket engine to fly
PROBLEM - with current class / interface design it is impossible to add fly()
to Duck class . We have 3560 ducks that cannot fly (rubber, robot, wood , stone etc...)
